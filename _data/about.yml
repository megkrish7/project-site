bio: |
  Hi there! I'm Phi Henry Nguyen, a Carnegie Mellon alum with a major in Information Systems and minors in Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Human Computer Interaction. If you'd like to indulge me in my Mary Poppins-inspired window into my personality through a list of some of my favorite things, check out this page!
  
  This summer, I will be starting my software engineering career at Schonfeld Strategic Advisors in NYC on the risk application technology team. I've worked previously as an intern at Cisco Meraki and Amazon on the Alexa AI Web Information team. I also have previous experience as a software developer at PatchRx, a teaching assistant for 15-112, a fast-paced introductory CS class at CMU taught in Python, and as a head teaching assistant for 67-272, a core IS class on web application development taught in Ruby on Rails.

  During my time at CMU, I was involved on campus as the Vice President of Events and Booth Chair for CMU's Asian Students Association, a web developer for Lunar Gala, a consultant and webmaster for 180 Degrees Consulting, and a professional development chair of Sigma Phi Epsilon.
