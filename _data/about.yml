bio: |
  Hey there! My name is Meghashyam Krishnasamy, a Junior at Carnegie Mellon University, diving into the world of Computer Science. Music is a big part of my life, whether I'm playing the double bass for orchestral pieces or strumming chords on my guitar, it's where I find my rhythm.

  When I'm not lost in music, you can usually find me on the soccer field. I'm passionate about the game, and you'll often find me kicking around a ball with friends or catching a match. Sports-wise, I'm a huge Steelers fan and proudly support Chelsea as well.

  Aside from my love for music and sports, I'm deeply involved in leadership and community service. Serving as President of Sigma Phi Epsilon, I focus on fostering brotherhood and personal growth within our community. I also dedicate my time to Camp Kesem, supporting children through the challenges of a parent's cancer journey.

  My journey to becoming an Eagle Scout has shaped who I am today, teaching me valuable lessons in resilience, integrity, and service. It's something I'm proud of and reflects my commitment to making a positive impact in my community.
