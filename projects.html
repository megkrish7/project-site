    <p>
        Welcome to my Projects page! Here, you'll find a curated showcase of my work, 
        reflecting my diverse interests and the culmination of my academic and professional 
        journey. Among these projects, you'll find my capstone, was a consulting project where 
        my team's client was the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences! My portfolio spans across various domains, but I am particularly
        passionate about the intersections of medtech and music. Each project here not only 
        demonstrates my skills and creativity but also my commitment to exploring and improving 
        technology in fields that deeply impact our lives. Dive in to discover how I blend technical 
        expertise with my passions to create solutions that aim to make a meaningful difference.
